# Learning Algorithms with C

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository where I'm documenting my journey in learning algorithms using the C programming language. I'm excited to share my progress and discoveries with you. Feel free to take a look at my code, contribute or provide any feedback.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of various algorithm implementations, challenges, and problem-solving exercises that I've encountered while learning algorithms using C. I've chosen C as my primary language for this project because I want to learn how to write efficient code and C is a language that is very close to the machine. I'm also using this project as a way to learn more about how the computer works and how to write code that is more efficient.

## Repository Structure

```

## Running main app

To run the main app, you can compile the code using the following command:

```bash
gcc main.c -o main
```

Then, you can run the program using the following command:

```bash
./main
```
